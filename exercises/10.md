## Exercise 10

Typelevel operations in TypeScript are fundamental, because the typesystem is structural we can easily manipulate types to contruct other types.

## KeyOf

The operator `keyof` is used to extract the keys of a type, write a `Person` interface and use `type PersonFields = keyof Person`

## TypeOf

The operator `typeof` is used to extract the type of a declaration, try to declare a function `add` of `numbers` and then use `typeof add`

## Indexed Access

Given a type `A` we can access its fields using `A[k]`, try it out on the type `Person` previously defined

## Mapped Types

Given a type `A` you can map its properties, and in general build types from union of keys using: `{[k in keyof A]: A[k]}`, try given the type `Person` previously defined to define a mapped type with the same fields all of the type number
