## Exercise 17

Using generics and overloads write a function `pipe` that is supposed to be used like:

```ts
const x = pipe(
  1,
  (n) => n + 1,
  (n) => n + 2
);

expect(x).toEqual(4);
```

That works for up to 3 parameters of which the first is a constant and the following a sequence of functions each taking as input the output of the previous
