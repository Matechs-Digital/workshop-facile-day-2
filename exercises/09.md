### Classes

We have already mentioned classes but never seen a class so far, a class can be thought as a `constructor` coupled with its type definition, behind the scenes classes are emulated using functions with prototype methods in older javascript versions and are supported natively by more recent js engines.

A class can be defined like:

```ts
class Person {
  public firstName: string;
  public lastName: string;

  constructor(firstName: string, lastName: string) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }

  send(message: string) {
    console.log(`Hey ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName} : ${message}`);
  }
}

const person = new Person("Michael", "Arnaldi");

person.send("ping");
```

### Pros

- can have private methods and state
- suppports getters and setters
- are quite fast, methods in classes are constructed at declaration time
  instanciating a new Person will only bind new variables for the state never recreate the methods.

### Cons

- because of the nature of prototypal functions we need to keep in mind to bind our
  functions to the correct instance if used in point-free places, this can be done like:

```ts
class Person {
  public firstName: string;
  public lastName: string;

  constructor(firstName: string, lastName: string) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;

    this.send = this.send.bind(this);
  }

  send(message: string) {
    console.log(`Hey ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName} : ${message}`);
  }
}
```

- Classes promotes a style of programming that couple data and behaviour and promotes mutability.
- Behaviour functions defined inside the class (and in general fluent-approach) is very limited type wise when it comes to generics.
- Because variance in typescript is not explicit but inferred from usage having behaviour defined inside the class breaks the type variance.

### Tradeoff

Use classess when you really really need classes, and when you do define the class as a pure implementation of a predefined interface like:

```ts
export interface Person {
  readonly firstName: string;
  readonly lastName: string;

  readonly send: (message: string) => void;
}

class PersonImpl implements Person {
  public firstName: string;
  public lastName: string;

  constructor(firstName: string, lastName: string) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.send = this.send.bind(this);
  }

  send(message: string) {
    console.log(`Hey ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName} : ${message}`);
  }
}

export function makePerson(firstName: string, lastName: string): Person {
  return new PersonImpl(firstName, lastName);
}

export const person = makePerson("Michael", "Arnaldi");
```
