### Exercise 05

We will now begin to explore Interfaces & Types, let's start by creating a new file `structural.ts`

### Interfaces

```ts
export interface Person {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
}
```

Interfaces introduce a new named context for object structures, you can assign to an `interface` any type that is structurally equivalent to the one you specify:

```ts
export const person: Person = {
  firstName: "Michael",
  lastName: "Arnaldi",
};
```

Interfaces can have `readonly` fields like:

```ts
export interface Person {
  readonly firstName: string;
  readonly lastName: string;
}
```

And when specified it will prevent mutability.

Let's write a test checking structural equivalence of the person object we created.

Interfaces can extend other interfaces for example we might write:

```ts
export interface Identified {
  id: string;
}
export interface User extends Identified {
  username: string;
}
```

Interfaces can have optional fields like:

```ts
export interface Person {
  middleName?: string;
}
```

### Types

Type definitions (or aliases) are similar to interfaces in some respect but wildely different in others that we will explore in details in the following days.

A new type alias can be defined as:

```ts
export type PersonType = {
  readonly firstName: string;
  readonly lastName: string;
};
```

But can also represent things like:

```ts
export type MyNumber = number;
```

Types don't per se introduce a naming context in the compiler so even if the compiler tries to show you a `PersonType` as being `PersonType` as soon as you start transformations it will quickly see the type as:

```ts
{
  readonly firstName: string;
  readonly lastName: string;
};
```

Types are incredibly powerful as they can contain dynamic logic and can represent a much broader set of cases that interfaces cannot, interfaces are better to keep "nominality".

As per interfaces types are checked structurally.
