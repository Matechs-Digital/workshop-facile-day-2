## Exercise 16

Function Overloads are a way to specify multiple signatures that a function definition can implement, overloads are weakly checked against the base type of the implementations.

For example we could write a function `sum` that works on both numbers and strings in the following way:

```ts
export function sum(x: string, y: string): string;
export function sum(x: number, y: number): number;
export function sum(x: number, y: number): number {
  return x + y;
}
```

The only problem is the compiler will scream, because the signature with `strings` can't be reconciled against the base implementation that only accepts numbers.

implement the base as:

```ts
export function sum(x: unknown, y: unknown): unknown;
```

Using type guards throwing an exception via an `absurd` function in case the types are not correct (impl bug)

Alternatively you can type it as:

```ts
export function sum(x: any, y: any): any;
```

Basically telling the compiler to not check the implementation, that in this case is safe because we won't be able to call the sum function with anything else except numbers or strings
