## Exercise 18

Using generics and overloads write a function `flow` that is supposed to be used like:

```ts
const f = flow(
  (n: number) => n + 1,
  (n) => n + 2,
  (n) => n + 3
);

expect(f(0)).toEqual(6);
```

That works for up to 3 parameters of which the first is a constant and the following a sequence of functions each taking as input the output of the previous
