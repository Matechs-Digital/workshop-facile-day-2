## Exercise 11

Generics are a fundamental concept of advanced type systems, using generics not only enables typing abstract shapes it also enables the compiler to correctly infer types by usage.

Generics are percieved as "complex" in reality they "simplify" a lot the definitions, when you read some signature that includes generics the places that mention generics are simply "generic" and it means you don't have to care what they are, you simply can't say a single thing about a type that is generic (if not explicitely constrained).

## Usage

```ts
interface Action<T> {
  name: string;
  payload: T;
}
```

## Constrains

```ts
interface Action<K extends "AddUser" | "DelUser", T> {
  name: K;
  payload: T;
}
```

## Generics in functions

```ts
function identity<A>(a: A): A {
  return a;
}
```

Write a function that given a generic action return it's payload
