### Exercise 07 Various

By using algebraic data types model the following domain in `src/e-commerce.ts`:

```ts
/**
 * SET 1 = E-COMMERCE
 *
 * Consider an e-commerce application that allows users to purchase products.
 */

/**
 * EXERCISE 1
 *
 * Using only tagged unions and interfaces, create an immutable data model
 * of a credit card, which must have:
 *
 *  * Number
 *  * Name
 *  * Expiration date
 *  * Security code
 */

// type CreditCard

/**
 * EXERCISE 2
 *
 * Using only tagged unions and interfaces, create an immutable data model
 * of a product, which could be a physical product, such as a liter of milk,
 * or a digital product, such as a book or movie, or access to an event, such
 * as a music concert or film showing.
 */

// type Product

/**
 * EXERCISE 3
 *
 * Using only tagged unions and interfaces, create an immutable data model
 * of a product price, which could be one-time purchase fee, or a recurring
 * fee on some regular interval.
 */

// type PricingScheme
```

```ts
/**
 * SET 2 = DOCUMENT EDITING
 *
 * Consider a web application that allows users to edit and store documents
 * of some type (which is not relevant for these exercises).
 */

// interface UserId {
//   identifier: string;
// }
// interface DocId {
//   identifier: string;
// }
// interface DocContent {
//   body: string;
// }

/**
 * EXERCISE 1
 *
 * Using only interfaces and tagged unions, create a simplified but somewhat
 * realistic model of a Document.
 */
// type Document

/**
 * EXERCISE 2
 *
 * Using only interfaces and tagged unions, create a model of the access
 * type that a given user might have with respect to a document. For example,
 * some users might have read-only permission on a document.
 */
// type AccessType

/**
 * EXERCISE 3
 *
 * Using only interfaces and tagged unions, create a model of the
 * permissions that a user has on a set of documents they have access to.
 * Do not store the document contents themselves in this model.
 */
// type DocPermissions
```

```ts
/**
 * SET 3 = BANKING
 *
 * Consider a banking application that allows users to hold and transfer money.
 */

/**
 * EXERCISE 1
 *
 * Using only interfaces and tagged unions, develop a model of a customer at a bank.
 */
// type Customer

/**
 * EXERCISE 2
 *
 * Using only interfaces and tagged unions, develop a model of an account
 * type. For example, one account type allows the user to write checks
 * against a given currency. Another account type allows the user to earn
 * interest at a given rate for the holdings in a given currency.
 */
// type AccountType

/**
 * EXERCISE 3
 *
 * Using only interfaces and tagged unions, develop a model of a bank
 * account, including details on the type of bank account, holdings, customer
 * who owns the bank account, and customers who have access to the bank account.
 */
// type Account
```

```ts
/**
 * SET 4 = STOCK PORTFOLIO - GRADUATION PROJECT
 *
 * Consider a web application that allows users to manage their portfolio of investments.
 */

/**
 * EXERCISE 1
 *
 * Using only interfaces and tagged unions, develop a model of a stock
 * exchange. Ensure there exist values for NASDAQ and NYSE.
 */
// type Exchange

/**
 * EXERCISE 2
 *
 * Using only interfaces and tagged unions, develop a model of a currency
 * type.
 */
// type CurrencyType

/**
 * EXERCISE 3
 *
 * Using only interfaces and tagged unions, develop a model of a stock
 * symbol. Ensure there exists a value for Apple's stock (APPL).
 */
// type StockSymbol

/**
 * EXERCISE 4
 *
 * Using only interfaces and tagged unions, develop a model of a portfolio
 * held by a user of the web application.
 */
// type Portfolio

/**
 * EXERCISE 5
 *
 * Using only interfaces and tagged unions, develop a model of a user of
 * the web application.
 */
// type User

/**
 * EXERCISE 6
 *
 * Using only interfaces and tagged unions, develop a model of a trade type.
 * Example trade types might include Buy and Sell.
 */
// type TradeType

/**
 * EXERCISE 7
 *
 * Using only interfaces and tagged unions, develop a model of a trade,
 * which involves a particular trade type of a specific stock symbol at
 * specific prices.
 */
// type Trade
```
